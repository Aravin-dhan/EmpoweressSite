## Why this Book Matters

Kavita Arora curates dissenting opinions from courts across South Asia, framing them as *queer pedagogies* for litigators.

### Key Takeaways for Feminist Litigators

- Dissents can seed future majority opinions when they include action-oriented remedies;
- Queer temporality challenges narrow limitation periods for relationship recognition; and
- Language lists (glossaries) make judgments accessible beyond elite legal circles.

## Favorite Chapter: *Madras HC and the Politics of Care*

The chapter reconstructs *S. Sushma v. Commissioner of Police* by centering queer mothers who provided safe houses when state shelters refused entry. It offers annotated briefs that bring positionality statements into the record.

> Reading this chapter felt like sitting in a litigation strategy meeting with queer organizers.

## Research Methods to Borrow

| Tool | How to adapt |
|------|--------------|
| Litigation zines | Summarize interim orders in community languages |
| Archival timelines | Track executive responses to queer rights litigation |
| Audio glossaries | Explain legal doctrine via WhatsApp voice notes |

This book is an invitation to write **judgments as pedagogy**. Each dissent is a syllabus, and each syllabus is a roadmap for feminist legal imagination.
