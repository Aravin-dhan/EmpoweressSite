## Movement Priorities

1. **Translate** every interim order into at least three regional languages;
2. **Budget** for care stipends inside litigation grants; and
3. **Digitize** annexures so community paralegals can run rapid fact checks.

## Litigation Sprint Rhythm

| Sprint | Focus | Outputs |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Sprint 1 | Evidence harvest | Shared repository, audio testimonies |
| Sprint 2 | Drafting | Annotated petitions, glossary decks |
| Sprint 3 | Hearing prep | Bench-specific briefs, moot recordings |

## Joy-Centered Lawyering

I maintain a *care docket* that lists who cooked, who needed rest, and who required tech access. Joy is a litigation resource, not an afterthought.
