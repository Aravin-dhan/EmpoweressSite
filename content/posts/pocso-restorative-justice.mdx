India’s Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) was drafted to be survivor-friendly, yet courtrooms still mirror colonial carcerality. Feminist legal clinics have experimented with **restorative companion circles** that travel with the survivor from FIR to final judgment.

## Designing Survivor Companions

A minimum package should include:

- Trained companions from the survivor’s linguistic community;
- Honoraria budgeted within District Child Protection Units; and
- Digital diaries that log every procedural interaction for evidentiary rebuttal.

### Evidence Reforms

1. Replace the “proof beyond reasonable doubt” script with **trauma-informed credibility matrices**;
2. Allow expert testimony from child psychologists at committal stage; and
3. Publish anonymized oral history databases to inform sentencing ranges.

## Community Accountability Circles

| Stakeholder | Responsibility |
|-------------|----------------|
| Survivor & family | Decide participation terms, opt-out options |
| Accused (if appropriate) | Acknowledge harm, agree to repair plan |
| Local state | Provide housing, education, and healthcare guarantees |

Circles must always be survivor-led, with clear exit clauses that route the matter back to adversarial courts if retraumatization risks emerge.

### Avoiding Token Restorative Pilots

Courts should adopt **sunset reviews**: every restorative order must publish compliance data six months later. Non-compliance triggers automatic reopening of sentencing.

## Legislative Wishlist

- Amend Section 33(8) POCSO to recognise community accountability statements as valid submissions;
- Budget for child-friendly technology that records testimony once, replays later; and
- Fund feminist monitoring cells to evaluate each restorative order.

A feminist POCSO jurisprudence is possible if we pair trauma-informed procedure with community-led accountability and transparent data reporting.
