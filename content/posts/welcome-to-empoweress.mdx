## Why We’re Here

We are starting something new today. Empoweress is a feminist legal blog—and more importantly, a space to think critically about how law shapes gendered lives. The law is not neutral. It reflects the society that creates it, and ours still carries deep inequities.

Women and queer people face discrimination in workplaces, courtrooms, and homes. Survivors of violence are routinely failed by legal systems. Policies are drafted without considering how they differentially impact caste, class, disability, or sexuality. We believe the law can still be a tool for justice, but that begins with interrogating it relentlessly.

## What We’ll Cover

- Constitutional law and women’s rights  
- Gender-based violence and state responses  
- Migration and gender justice  
- Child protection statutes like POCSO  
- Workplace discrimination and sexual harassment  
- Reproductive autonomy and health rights  
- LGBTQIA+ rights and queer jurisprudence  
- How courts interpret gender—and who gets left behind  

You can expect rapid case comments when landmark judgments drop, comparative notes across jurisdictions, and long-form essays that stitch together doctrine, data, and lived experience. Our writing will always be thoroughly cited yet accessible.

## Who This Is For

Empoweress is for anyone invested in gender and law: law students encountering feminist theory for the first time, researchers and litigators deep in the trenches, or readers who simply care about justice. Expertise is welcome, but it is not required—curiosity and rigor are.

## How We’re Different

Most legal blogs stop at describing what the law says. We ask harder questions: Does this law work? Who does it protect? Who does it burden? What assumptions about gender underpin it? We take an intersectional view, tracing how caste, class, religion, disability, and sexuality collide with gender in the courtroom.

We’re comfortable critiquing systems, pointing out when courts miss the mark, and highlighting where laws fall short. Accountability requires candor.

## Join the Collective

- **Pitch us** at `submissions@empoweress.site`. Include a 150–200 word abstract, key sources, and disclosures if you’re writing about ongoing matters.
- **Contribute** as the editorial desk grows—we’ll publish calls for editors and researchers soon.
- **Read, share, and discuss**. Thoughtful comments, references, and dissenting views are welcome.

Change rarely happens overnight; legal reform is slow. But scholarship, strategy, and public dialogue push that work forward. Every judgment we examine, every statute we critique, and every voice we publish feeds a broader movement for justice.

Thank you for being here. Let’s begin.
