## Headline

Use this template as a reference when drafting new Empoweress posts. Keep it in the `content/posts/` folder; the `status: "draft"` flag ensures it never renders publicly.

### Structure

- **Introduction**: 2–3 paragraphs that situate the legal issue.
- **Analysis**: Break down doctrine, evidence, or field notes, using headings & components like `<InfoBox>` or `<LegalCaseBox>`.
- **Actionables**: End with checklists, toolkits, or calls to action.

### Notes

- Update the frontmatter before publishing (slug, date, tags, etc.).
- Remove unused socials/fields to avoid clutter.
- Save media assets to remote sources allowed by `next.config.ts` or extend the config as needed.
