“Managed retreat” in policy memos often translates into feminized precarity on the ground. Fishing communities along India’s eastern coast show how climate adaptation, when gender-blind, reproduces caste labour hierarchies.

## Feminist Federalism for Climate Relocation

Article 246A already enables GST-style cooperation. We can adapt that logic for **Climate Care Compacts**:

- **Ward-level gender data audits** before relocation;
- **Joint financing** from state disaster funds and District Mineral Foundations; and
- **Constitutional obligations** to publish gendered rehabilitation scorecards.

### Panchayat Feminist Relocation Councils

Kerala’s Kudumbashree groups have piloted *care panchayats* that negotiate land swaps, skill pipelines, and mental health clinics. Scaling this model needs a constitutional amendment that links Article 243G functions with climate relocation checklists.

## Labour Transition with Dignity

We must move from “livelihood packages” to **wage insurance**:

1. Enumerate informal skills (net mending, salting, shell craft);
2. Provide credit guarantees for worker-owned cooperatives; and
3. Tie relocation approvals to demonstrable wage parity in the new site.

> Wage justice is migration justice. Anything less is constitutional negligence.

### Case Brief: *Parvathi v. Union of India* (Madras HC, 2023)

The court ordered desalination plants but ignored fisherwomen’s protests about unsafe night travel. A feminist appeal would have added:

- Community-controlled transport funds;
- Mobile childcare pods; and
- Gender-sensitive workplace harassment cells at new industrial sites.

## Building a Litigation Toolkit

| Litigation Tool | Feminist Use-case |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Article 32 PILs | Challenge relocation plans lacking gender impact disclosures |
| Finance Commission memos | Argue for migration ceilings tied to unpaid care ratios |
| Climate Budget tagging | Demand gender parity in adaptive infrastructure |

The next frontier is **community-authored amicus briefs** that bring sonic maps, collective testimonies, and data visualizations into constitutional record.
